kmeans
======

A simple kmeans implementation I've made just to play with cmake and to remember some c++ (it's been a long time since I coded a bit). I decided to implement this basic technique after  a friend told me he were implementing this EM algorithm for a job interview (this is in C++, hope this doesn't cause problems to anybody), then I realized I never implemented this technique in C++ (I've got one in c#, python and lisp but none in C++) so I spent a few hours of my weekend doing it

The code works in linux (and windows, but c'mon don't use it)
